### Supplier Invoice and Payment Forecasting

**Raghu Prashanth**

#### Executive summary
This project focuses on visualizing and forecasting supplier invoices and payments to support financial planning and supplier management. By leveraging synthetic data simulating invoice and payment records with seasonality and trend-based indicators, the project employs time series models like SARIMA and classification techniques to identify high-risk invoices. The goal is to provide interactive visualizations and reliable forecasts, enabling businesses to anticipate invoice volumes, manage payments efficiently, and mitigate risks.

#### Rationale
Supplier invoice and payment management directly impacts financial stability and operational continuity. Late or missed payments strain supplier relationships and disrupt supply chains, while unmanaged invoice spikes can hinder liquidity planning. This project helps businesses anticipate payment needs, reduce risks associated with high-priority or delayed invoices, and improve supplier relationships, ensuring smooth operations and financial predictability.

#### Research Question
How can businesses effectively visualize and forecast supplier invoices and payments to enhance financial planning and reduce supplier-related risks?

#### Data Sources
The project uses synthetic data created using Python’s Faker and Pandas libraries, simulating:
	•	Supplier Invoices: Daily invoice records with varying volumes, urgency, supplier ratings, and seasonal adjustments.
	•	Supplier Payments: Historical payment records, including partial payments and payment delays.

This data reflects real-world scenarios such as seasonal spikes, and fluctuations.
